# Hello World

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Write a program that greets the user by name, or by saying "Hello, World!" if no name is given.

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language.

**Note:** You can skip this exercise by running:

    exercism skip $LANGUAGE hello-world

## Specification

The `Hello World!` program will greet me, the caller.

If I tell the program my name is Alice, it will greet me by saying "Hello, Alice!".

If I neglect to give it my name, it will greet me by saying "Hello, World!"

## Test-Driven Development

As programmers mature, they eventually want to test their code.

Here at Exercism we simulate [Test-Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD), where you write your tests before writing any functionality. The simulation comes in the form of a pre-written test suite, which will signal that you have solved the problem.

It will also provide you with a safety net to explore other solutions without breaking the functionality.

### A typical TDD workflow on Exercism:

1. Run the test file and pick one test that's failing.
2. Write some code to fix the test you picked.
3. Re-run the tests to confirm the test is now passing.
4. Repeat from step 1.
5. Submit your solution (`exercism submit /path/to/file`)

## Instructions

Submissions are encouraged to be general, within reason. Having said that, it's also important not to over-engineer a solution.

It's important to remember that the goal is to make code as expressive and readable as we can. However, solutions to the hello-world exercise will not be reviewed by a person, but by rikki- the robot, who will offer an encouraging word.
=======
The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language
or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `exercism/python/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.py` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/python/bob/bob.py`.
